# Skill: Generate Phase Issues

Decompose one ROADMAP **phase** (`vA.B`) into a small, dependency-ordered **issues file** at
`specification/implementation/vA.B-issues.md`. The file is the input to `/upload-issues` → `/execute-issues`
(GitHub flow), or straight to `/execute-issues-file` (offline flow).

## Usage

```
/generate-issues <phase>
```

- `/generate-issues v1.1` or `/generate-issues 1.1`: ROADMAP phase **v1.1** (project skeleton and the
  receiver link) → `specification/implementation/v1.1-issues.md`

One file per phase. Issue ids (`SRUTI-###`) are **globally sequential** across phase files **and across
regeneration runs**. Never reset them.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Read inputs

1. Normalize the argument to `vA.B` and check it exists as a `### vA.B` heading in
   [specification/ROADMAP.md](../../../specification/ROADMAP.md). For anything else, name it and ask.
   (v2 and v3 are not phased in the ROADMAP yet; they must be broken into `### vA.B` phases there before
   issues can be generated.)
2. Read ROADMAP.md §`vA.B`: the phase's **Goal**, description, **Tasks**, **DoD** (including which items are
   **Manual (owner)** — anything that needs a live receiver, a real model run or a quality judgment) and
   **Tests**, plus the version heading (`## vA`) it sits under.
3. Read [specification/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../specification/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the mechanisms and
   **contracts** the phase touches (the record shapes, the segmenter rules, the two-tier table, the KiwiSDR
   protocol), and [specification/MISSION.md](../../../specification/MISSION.md) for the principles and
   **non-goals**. The scope fence is the phase itself plus the non-goals: never pull a later phase's work in
   early, and never add what no phase asks for.
4. Read `CLAUDE.md` for the acceptance gates and the rules that are easy to break.
5. **Find the next free `SRUTI-###` id. Never restart the numbering.** Check both sources and continue
   from the higher:

   ```bash
   # (a) GitHub: survives a wiped working tree (skip if the repo has no remote)
   gh issue list --state all --limit 1000 --json title \
     --jq '.[].title | capture("SRUTI-(?<n>[0-9]+)").n' 2>/dev/null | sort -n | tail -1

   # (b) local issues files: covers ids drafted but not uploaded
   grep -rhoE 'SRUTI-[0-9]+' --include='*-issues.md' specification/implementation/ 2>/dev/null \
     | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sed 's/^0*//' | sort -n | tail -1
   ```

   Pass the directory with `--include`, not a `*-issues.md` glob. Under zsh an unmatched glob aborts the
   command before `2>/dev/null` applies, and `specification/implementation/` may not exist yet.

   The next id is `max(a, b) + 1`, zero-padded to three digits. Start at `SRUTI-001` only if both sources
   come back empty. Say in the report which sources were checked: with no remote, or with `gh`
   unauthenticated, (b) alone governs.
6. If `specification/implementation/vA.B-issues.md` already exists, ask whether to overwrite or append.

### Step 0.5: Reconcile with the real implementation

Ground the phase in what was actually built and fixed, not only in what the specification describes. Review
fixes and hardening in earlier phases may have moved the code away from the docs.

1. Read the **real current code** this phase builds on: the Python package (receiver, segmenter, glossary,
   explain, store, ui modules), `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example` and the glossary data files. Note
   the actual module and function names, signatures, config keys and env var names.
2. Read the earlier phases' `specification/implementation/*-execution-report.md` and `*code-review*.md`,
   especially their **"Fixes applied"** and **"Architecture impact"** notes.
3. Where ARCHITECTURE.md or ROADMAP.md is stale relative to a landed fix, the **code is ground truth** for
   this phase's issues. Note the drift, and put the ARCHITECTURE.md correction into the issue that touches
   that contract.
4. For owner-run tasks (live receiver sessions, recordings, real model runs, quality judgments), check what
   can be checked offline — e.g. whether the v0.1 recordings or golden examples already exist in the repo —
   and ask the owner about the rest. A task that is already done becomes a verification-only issue, not new
   work. Never connect to a public receiver or call a paid API on your own.

### Step 1: Decompose the phase

Turn the phase's tasks into a small set of issues, typically **2–5**. An owner-only phase such as v0.1 (the
receiver spike) may be a single issue. Don't pad. Each issue is a coherent, independently verifiable slice:

- **Size** by complexity:
  - **S:** one function or file.
  - **M:** a feature across a few files.
  - **L:** a new component or a contract change.
- **Area**, one of:
  - `receiver`: the KiwiSDR link (audio channel, CW_decoder extension, raw-message events, reconnect,
    busy/time-limit states).
  - `segmenter`: the pure characters → pieces logic (sessions are manual, owned by the core/store).
  - `store`: the append-only JSONL session store — saving, listing, replay, the manual session switch.
  - `glossary`: the versioned data files and their rendering into prompts.
  - `explain`: the local (Ollama, gloss + message) and cloud (Claude, on the Explain action) explainers.
  - `ui`: the TUI (v1 — the four sections, the config panel with the capture inspector, the session
    switcher) and the web interface (v2 — localhost only).
  - `config`: `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, CI workflows, configuration loading.
  - `tests`.
  - `docs`: the `specification/` files, README.md, CLAUDE.md.
  - `ops`: steps the owner performs — live receiver sessions, recordings, opt-in model evals.
- **Order by dependency.** The first issue is usually the gate that everything builds on. In v1.1 that is
  the project skeleton plus configuration loading; in v1.2 it is the pure segmenter module.
- **Tests in every code issue.** Keep decision logic pure so it can be unit-tested with plain data: the
  piece cut rules, `cw_chars` decoding, prompt assembly, output-schema validation, the Explain trigger
  handling, the cost accounting, the interface's view models. Ollama and the Claude API are mocked, the
  fake receiver replays recordings, the TUI is driven headless, the clock is injected, and no test touches
  the network.
- **Manual DoD checks** from ROADMAP.md go into the acceptance criteria as **Manual (owner):** items. The
  executor cannot pass them on its own.
- **Contract changes:** a change to anything in CLAUDE.md **Contracts** (the record shapes, the segmenter
  thresholds, the local JSON schema, the CLI, the session-log format) carries the ARCHITECTURE.md update and
  the test that pins it, in the **same** issue.
- **Owner-run (`ops`) issues:**
  - List the exact steps from ROADMAP.md (which receiver, which frequency, what to record).
  - Mark which checks Claude can run offline from the repo (fixtures, replays).
  - Name any repo artifact the issue produces (e.g. a recorded session under `specification/examples/` or
    the fixtures directory).
- **Stay within the phase.** No Ollama before v1.3, no TUI before v1.4, no cloud explainer before v1.5,
  no web interface before v2, nothing from MISSION.md's non-goals (no transmitting, no digital modes, no
  LAN- or internet-facing server).

### Step 2: Write the issues file

Write `specification/implementation/vA.B-issues.md` in English. Use **exactly** this format:

````markdown
# vA.B — Issues

Issues for phase **vA.B — {title}** (version **vA — {version title}**), derived from the Tasks and DoD in
[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) §vA.B and the contracts in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md). This file
covers one phase; ids continue from the previous phase (SRUTI-{prev} → **SRUTI-{first}…{last}**).

{1–3 sentences: what the phase delivers, what it builds on, what it leaves for later phases.}

## Issues Summary Table

| # | ID | Title | Size | Area | Phase | Dependencies |
|---|----|-------|------|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | SRUTI-{first} | {title} | M | receiver | vA.B | -- |
| 2 | SRUTI-{…} | {title} | S | tests | vA.B | SRUTI-{first} |

**Size legend:** S = one function or file · M = a feature across a few files · L = a new component or a contract change

---

## Dependency Tree

```
SRUTI-{first} ({gate})
  |
  +-- SRUTI-{…} (…)
  |
  +-- SRUTI-{…} (…)  => {phase DoD}
```

**Parallelization hints:** {what must go first; what is independent}.

---

## vA.B — {title}

### SRUTI-{id} — {Title}

**Description:**
{1–3 sentences; name the files it touches.}

**What needs to be done:**
- {bullet}

**Dependencies:** {SRUTI ids, or None}

**Expected result:**
{one sentence}

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] {functional criterion}
- [ ] **Tests:** {the unit tests added, with models mocked / the fake receiver}
- [ ] **Contract:** {contract + the test that pins it + the ARCHITECTURE.md update} — *(only if a contract changes)*
- [ ] **Gates:** {which of lint / tests apply}
- [ ] **Manual (owner):** {DoD check from ROADMAP.md §vA.B} — *(only where the DoD needs a live receiver, a real model or a quality judgment)*

---

{repeat the `### SRUTI-{id} …` block per issue}

## vA.B scope notes

**Critical path:** SRUTI-{…} → … → SRUTI-{…}.
**Phase DoD (ROADMAP.md §vA.B):** {restate the DoD}.
**Contracts touched:** {contracts + their tests, or "none"}.
**Owner steps:** {live receiver sessions, recordings or model runs the owner must perform, or "none"}.
**Not in this phase:** {nearby work that belongs to a later phase or to no phase}.
**Generated later:** `vA.B-github-report.md` (on upload), `vA.B-execution-report.md` (on execution).
````

### Step 3: Report

Show the user the file path, the issue count, the `SRUTI-###` range, the critical path, and which id
sources were checked. Suggest the next step:

```
/upload-issues @specification/implementation/vA.B-issues.md   # GitHub flow
/execute-issues-file vA.B                                     # offline flow
```

Do **not** create GitHub issues or commit here. This skill only writes the local file, so the user can
read and edit it first.

## Important Rules

- **One file per phase**, at `specification/implementation/vA.B-issues.md`.
- **Ids are globally sequential** (`SRUTI-###`) across phase files and regeneration runs. Resolve the next id
  as `max(GitHub, local issues files) + 1`.
- **Tests in every code issue**, with Ollama and the Claude API mocked and the fake receiver for the link.
  Manual DoD checks are labeled **Manual (owner):**.
- **Contract change = ARCHITECTURE.md + the pinning test**, all in the same issue.
- **Stay within the phase** and outside MISSION.md's non-goals. Simplicity beats completeness.
- **Honor the DoD.** Together, the issues must satisfy the phase DoD in ROADMAP.md §vA.B.
- **Ask on ambiguity.** If a task is under-specified, ask before inventing scope.
- **Don't touch GitHub.** `/upload-issues` does that.
