# Skill: Upload Phase Issues to GitHub

Upload the issues from one phase issues file to GitHub one at a time, with labels prefixed by the phase and
with dependency links. Then record the `SRUTI-###` → GitHub number mapping.

## Usage

```
/upload-issues <phase-issues-file>
```

Example: `/upload-issues @specification/implementation/v1.1-issues.md`

If the file doesn't exist yet, run `/generate-issues vA.B` first.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Preconditions

1. `gh auth status`. If it isn't authenticated, tell the user to run `gh auth login` and stop.
2. `git remote -v`. If the repo has no GitHub remote, stop. Tell the user to create one (`gh repo create`)
   or to use the offline flow (`/execute-issues-file vA.B`). Never create the remote yourself.

### Step 1: Read the issues file

Determine the phase `vA.B` from the filename or heading. The label prefix is `vA.B::`.

From the **Issues Summary Table**, parse each issue's ID, Title, Size, Area, Phase and Dependencies. Then
parse each `### SRUTI-###` section: Description, What needs to be done, Dependencies, Expected result,
Acceptance criteria.

### Step 2: Confirm with the user

Show the target repository, the number of issues, and the full list of labels. Ask for confirmation.

### Step 3: Create labels (if missing)

Labels have the form `vA.B::{category}` or `vA.B::{category}:{value}`. The phase title for the `vA.B::phase`
description comes from its `### vA.B` heading in `specification/ROADMAP.md`.

```bash
gh label create "v1.1::phase"  --color "0E8A16" --description "Phase v1.1 — Project skeleton and the receiver link" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "v1.1::size:S" --color "28A745" --description "Small — one function or file" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "v1.1::size:M" --color "FFC107" --description "Medium — a feature across a few files" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "v1.1::size:L" --color "DC3545" --description "Large — a new component or a contract change" 2>/dev/null || true
# one per area used in this phase: receiver, segmenter, glossary, explain, ui, config, tests, docs, ops
gh label create "v1.1::area:receiver" --color "1D76DB" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "v1.1::area:ops"      --color "D93F0B" --description "Owner performs: live receivers, recordings, model evals" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 4: Create issues one by one

Create the issues **sequentially, one `gh issue create` per issue, never batched**, in summary-table order.
After each one, show the result and move straight on; don't wait for confirmation between issues.

1. **Skip duplicates.** If an issue whose title starts with `SRUTI-###:` already exists, skip it and record
   its existing number:
   `gh issue list --state all --search "SRUTI-### in:title" --json number,title`.
2. Build the body:

   ```markdown
   ## Description
   {description}

   ## What needs to be done
   {full content}

   ## Dependencies
   {dependency list, with #numbers of already-created issues}

   ## Expected result
   {expected result}

   ## Acceptance criteria
   {checklist, including any **Manual (owner):** items}

   ---
   **ID:** {SRUTI-###}
   **Size:** {S/M/L}
   **Phase:** {vA.B}
   **Area:** {receiver/segmenter/glossary/explain/ui/config/tests/docs/ops}
   ```

3. Create it:

   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "SRUTI-###: {title}" \
     --label "vA.B::phase,vA.B::size:{S/M/L},vA.B::area:{area}" \
     --body "$(cat <<'BODY'
   {issue body}
   BODY
   )"
   ```

4. Record the mapping `SRUTI-###` → `#number` and report `Created SRUTI-### -> #{number}: {title}`.
5. For each dependency that is already created, comment:
   `gh issue comment {number} --body "Blocked by #{dep-number} (SRUTI-###)"`.

### Step 5: Write and commit the report

Write `specification/implementation/vA.B-github-report.md`:

```markdown
# Phase vA.B — GitHub Issues Report

**Uploaded:** {date}
**Repository:** {repo URL}
**Total issues:** {count} ({created} created, {skipped} already existed)

## Issue Mapping

| SRUTI ID | GitHub # | Title | Phase | Labels | URL |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|-----|
| SRUTI-001 | #5 | ... | v1.1 | v1.1::phase, v1.1::size:S, v1.1::area:receiver | {url} |

## Labels Created

- vA.B::phase
- vA.B::size:S, vA.B::size:M, vA.B::size:L
- vA.B::area:{list}
```

Commit the issues file (if it isn't committed yet) together with the report as
`docs: upload vA.B issues to GitHub`, with the running model's `Co-Authored-By` trailer, and push.
`/execute-issues` needs a clean tree and reads this mapping.

### Step 6: Report to the user

Report the number of issues created and skipped, a link to the repository's issues page, and the report
path. Suggest `/execute-issues vA.B::phase`.

## Error Handling

- **`gh` unauthenticated:** tell the user to run `gh auth login`.
- **No remote:** tell the user to run `gh repo create`, or to use `/execute-issues-file`.
- **Issue with the same `SRUTI-###` already exists:** skip it and note it in the report.
- **Label creation fails:** continue; the labels may already exist.
- **Any other failure:** report what was created so far and what remains, and still write the report for
  the created issues.
